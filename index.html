  <div id="intro">
    <div class="largecopy copycolor">
      Eero is a dialect of Objective-C designed to make developers more productive through improved code readability, maintainability, and safety.

  <div id="facts" class="accentbackgoundcolor">
    <div class="largecopy copycolor">
      <span>The myth?</span> "It's just syntax." <span>The fact:</span>  Readability matters. Code is read many more times than it’s written—and after a few months, even your own code can start to look like someone else’s. Eero’s streamlined syntax and Python-like indentation make code easier to read, understand, and maintain.

<div id="benefits" class="softbackgroundcolor">
    <div id="save_time">
      <span class="largecopy copycolor">time-saving</span>
      <div class="copy">
        Poor code readability costs you development time. Syntactic "noise," redundant notation, and boilerplate all 
        distract and provide opportunities for "dumb" and sometimes subtle errors. No language can guarantee clean code, 
        but Eero helps you do a better job.

    <div id="interoperable">
      <span class="largecopy copycolor">highly interoperable</span></h2>
      <div class="copy copycolor">
        Excellent, nearly seamless, interoperability with Objective-C, C, and C++. Just import and use SDK, third-party, 
        and personal frameworks and libraries. And all LLVM memory management choices are available, 
        including manual reference counting and ARC.
      </div>
    </div>    
    <div id="performance">
      <span class="largecopy copycolor">high-performance</span></h2>
      <div class="copy copycolor">
        Compiles down to the same binary code as Objective-C, so you'll enjoy the same performance as standard LLVM-generated Objective-C code. 
        This includes any high-performance C functions or C++ objects you use!
