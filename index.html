  <h2>what is eero?</h2>
  Eero is a fully binary- and header-compatible dialect of Objective-C, implemented with a 
  modified version of the Apple-sponsored LLVM/clang open-source compiler. It features a streamlined syntax, 
  Python-like indentation, and other features that improve readability and code safety. It is inspired by 
  languages such as Smalltalk, Python, and Ruby. 

  <p>"Eero" is pronounced [ˈe-rō]‚ and is similar to the English word "aero".</p>
