      The first idea I had for eero was to remove the “slum of braces” from Objective-C. My wife had told me about the idea 
      behind the design of the Tulip chair and Pedestal table by the Finnish-American architect and industrial designer 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eero_Saarinen">Eero Saarinen</a>. His goal in creating this table and chairs, 
      which rest on round bases, was to clean up the “slum of legs” that had always been present in dining-room furniture. 
      Given our mutual interest in reduction and simplification, it seemed fitting to name my Objective-C dialect after him.

    <div id="arvanitis" class="copy copycolor">
      After receiving my B.S.E.E. from the University of Michigan, I went to work in software development. I’ve worked for 
      large companies like Nokia, Texas Instruments, and McDonnell Douglas (a.k.a Boeing); some medium and small companies; 
      and for myself. I’ve programmed professionally in C, C++, Objective-C, Python, Java, JavaScript, Ada, and even Pascal 
      and Fortran (sorry if I’ve forgotten anyone… oh yeah, assembly).
