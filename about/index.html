<h3><em>Removing the “Slum of Braces” from Objective-C</em></h3>

My wife once told me about the idea behind the design of the Tulip chair and 
Pedestal table by the Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen, who is perhaps 
best known for designing St. Louis’ Gateway Arch. His goal in creating this table 
and chairs, which rest on round bases, was to clean up the “slum of legs” that 
had always been present in dining-room furniture. Coincidentally, Saarinen also 
had taught at the Cranbrook Institute of Science, which is near my hometown of 
Detroit and which I had visited as a child. Given that and our mutual interest 
in reduction and simplification, it seemed fitting to name this dialect after him.

<h2>about me</h2>

After receiving my B.S.E.E. from the University of Michigan, I went to work in 
software development. I’ve worked for large companies like Nokia, Texas Instruments, 
and McDonnell Douglas (a.k.a Boeing); some medium and small companies; and for myself. 
I’ve programmed professionally in C, C++, Objective-C, Python, Java, JavaScript, Ada, 
and even Pascal and Fortran (sorry if I’ve forgotten anyone… oh yeah, assembly). 
I now work and live in San Francisco.
