<h3><em>Removing the “slum of braces” from Objective-C</em></h3>

My wife once told me about the idea behind the design of the Tulip chair and 
Pedestal table by the Finnish-American architect and industrial designer
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eero_Saarinen">Eero Saarinen</a>. His goal 
in creating this table and chairs, which rest on round bases, was to clean up 
the “slum of legs” that had always been present in dining-room furniture. Given 
our mutual interest in reduction and simplification, it seemed fitting to name 
this dialect after him.

<h2>about me</h2>

After receiving my B.S.E.E. from the University of Michigan, I went to work in 
software development. I’ve worked for large companies like Nokia, Texas Instruments, 
and McDonnell Douglas (a.k.a Boeing); some medium and small companies; and for myself. 
I’ve programmed professionally in C, C++, Objective-C, Python, Java, JavaScript, Ada, 
and even Pascal and Fortran (sorry if I’ve forgotten anyone… oh yeah, assembly). 

<p>I work and live in San Francisco.</p>
